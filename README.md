# PQ_Datalogger
This work presents a high-precision, edge-computing data logger for real-time spike-based load profiling. The system integrates Halleffect current sensors, high-voltage transducers, and high-speed ADCs controlled by an STM32H7 microcontroller to perform synchronised voltage–current sampling, PQ computation, and transient detection.
